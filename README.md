# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is very important because it will dictate resource consumption like cost of labour and other resources needed. Project manager can ensure that deadlines are met by ensuring that they have time schedule for various activities and also provide leaderships through proper communication and being a team player.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
effective cost control ensures that the cost of the project is within the stipulated amount. To prevent budget overruns, there should be a clear project scope, continuous cost reporting, proper risk management and detailed planning before the project is started. 
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology is quick flexible with intention of delivering project that meets dynamic user needs whereas waterfall methodology is static method that allows movement to the next step only possible if the preceeding stages has been completed entirely.
advantages 
waterfall - Can be useful where the budget is very tight and user requirements are clearly known.
Agile - useful in projects where the user requirements are not very clear and it is flexible 
disadvantages 
Waterfall - Static and may not accommade ever changing user requirements
Agile - Must become expensive if the project is not controlled
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile - beneficial in projects that are new and there are less user requirements known and flexible projects.
Waterfall - Beneficial in projects with clear user requirements  that can easily be identified with static nature.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Conducting testing - such as unit, system and acceptance testing to ensure quality. It is important to maintain high standards to be able to meet the market requirements, attract new markets and maintain old ones too.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope ensure that only activities included would be carried out and will help in eliminating unnecessary expenses, WBS - this a technique used to manage projects by breaking down bigger projects into smaller units that are managable. 
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Better resource allocation, clarity of the project, reduced project risks. Gantt Chart helps in outling the timelines and the resources needed in the various stages of project implementation.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The software addresses problems by developing the solution to such problems. The problems acts as the roadmap in acquiring the user requirements that lays a fundamental foundation of developing a solution to the problem.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
it will help in ensuring Focus on Relevant Features and Requirements, understanding user requirements, getting project objectives in a right manner
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
outlining the problem, proposed solution and demonstration briefly using more graphics  than texts.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
- Functional features that seek to answer the problems of the users.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
- Feedback and google analytics coupled with mmarket surveys
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
- It will guide in the use of technology that would accomodate more users.
